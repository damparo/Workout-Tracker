# Workout-Tracker


## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a Work Out Tracker application that could be used to create or continue an exercise and saving it all to a Mongo database.

## Functionality

On the app, the user can record thier exercises or create news by filling out specifics like duration, weight, and reps.  There's also an option for recording running times. The work out tracker uses a Mongoose schema and Mongo database to store and retrieve different the exercises. Theres also a graph that shows user progress.
